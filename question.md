### Intermediate
- What are the OOP principles?
  - Inheritance: Reusing code by creating a parent-child relationship.

  - Data Abstraction: Displaying only important information and hiding implementation details.
- What is the difference between `String` and `StringBuilder`?
- If a class has three static variables, when are these variables pushed to memory, and when are they cleaned up?
